<div class="title">About Us</div>
<div class="description">
	We are an independent development studio started by two brothers in beautiful Seattle, Washington. We've been playing and making games casually since we were kids and are now doing it professionally.
	We specialize in creating tools and frameworks for other aspiring and professional game developers to use. Our favorite games include Ocarina of Time, Beyond Good and Evil, Eternal Darkness, Horizon: Zero Dawn
	and Advent Rising (where is our sequel Mustard Brothers?!).
