It's every young gamer's fantasy to grow up and make their dream games and it was no different for us Larson brothers. Now established, older and somewhat wiser, that dream has finally come to fruition. We've been playing and making games for 25+ years. Starting when he reached high school Adam began creating arcade clones, a full fledged Flash space shooter, and other addicting internet games that were prevalent on the internet back then. Adam got a degree in computer science and became a professional game and technology developer. Luke, six years younger, garnered all his programming knowledge from his older brother as he made his way down a different career path all the while hoping that they would one day toss it aside and make the ideas that had burgeoned for 25 years come to life.

That day has finally come. So now we are supremely excited to annouce PiRho Soft's first official game...

The Art of War is a 2D, multiplayer, twin-stick, platformer shooter. It's designed to be a robust competitive multiplayer sandbox with configurability to play in a variety of gametypes, scenarios, arenas, etc. The idea stems from the times as a kid drawing pictures with your friends, in a creative battle to see who could come up with the more cunning or powerful weapon (if you've seen [_Crocodile Dundee_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWl8EbNN8NM) or the even more hilarious [_Simpsons_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcE0aAhbVFc) then you know what we mean). With the Art of War we want to make your childhood creations, from the most mundane to the wildly imaginitive, come to life.

We know that collecting things is what makes many games fun and addictive. Your character is created by combining one of each of four modular parts: a **head**, a **core**, some **arms**, and some **legs**. And there will be dozens of each. Want to fly? Strap on a jetpack for your core. Like to move quickly? Lace up the Ground Bolts for your legs (they make you run usainly fast). Maybe you're playing defense in a capture the flag match. You can wear a football helmet for extra protection. We want to see players explore their imagination to come up with the best combination of parts in a variety of gametypes. You unlock parts by beating single player scenarios against bots, or by opening booster packs which you can purchase or earn just by playing.

But none of this matters if the gameplay itself isn't fun. The inception of The Art of War dates back to the Indie Games Conference hosted by _Garage Games_ in Eugene, OR 2007. We put together a barebones prototype in a couple of nights just to see what would happen. By the end of the weekend we had an 8 player splitscreen(!) battle happening with bullets flying everywhere and yelps of fright and joy from everybody. We are making sure to stay true to that earliest version of fast, frenetic, gameplay with tight controls. Now our experience and freedow allows us to pay attention to the detail, smoothness, and polish that we at PiRho Soft take much pride in.

The Art of War is being made for Xbox and PC on the Universal Windows Platform as part of Microsoft's [Dream.Build.Play](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/projects/campaigns/dream-build-play-challenge) event. It will support online matchmaking play as well as local and online split screen all up to 4k resolution. We aim to have a prerelease version completed and on the Windows Store by December 31st. Here's a look at some early gameplay footage (as you can see, we have not enlisted the help of artists yet).
