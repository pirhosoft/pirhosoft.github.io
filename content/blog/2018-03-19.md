After about 8 months of developement we are proud to release version 1.0 of The Art of War ([get it on Windows 10 or Xbox One](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/the-art-of-war-game/9pgj9477r23x)).
If you played the preview release there's now
a lot more content in the game that you have to look forward to. We've also changed the focus of acquiring new content from a random
acquisition model to a goal driven model. This is a side effect of not being able to provide online multiplayer (details below) but in
this case we believe it has improved the overall experience.

Overall we are very happy with our final product. The feedback we have received so far has been mostly positive and we have accomplished
what we set out to accomplish 8 months ago. Being the first release as an independent studio we've learned an incredible amount that we can apply
to our future projects. One of the most important things we learned is to always figure out the limitations of the platform you are developing
for...

We spent a lot of time developing the online multiplayer only to find out that the Xbox Creators Program doesn't allow online interaction.
This is an understandable limitation as it would require a bunch of resources on Microsoft's part and something we should have researched
before investing so much time. Disapponting as that is, we were able to able to focus more on the local couch aspect of the game which is
the way it is the most fun to play anyway. Consequently, we do have the capability for online play so if there is demand for that in the 
future we can make that happen. Possibilities would be to go through the ID@Xbox program or a general PC/Steam release. Let us know!

For now we are starting to think about our next project. We know this will be a single player, story driven adventure, and we intend to
document our development progress (much better than we did for The Art of War) here and on our social media accounts. So stay tuned for more in
the coming weeks!
