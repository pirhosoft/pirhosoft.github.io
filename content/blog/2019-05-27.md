# Yielding Coroutines Without Delay

The title of this post might seem contradictory since the purpose of [coroutines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html) in [Unity](https://unity.com/) is to _intruduce_ delay, but for our soon to be released [Composition Framework](https://pirhosoft.com/projects/unity-composition) we needed this delay to be optional. The framework implements a [graph](https://pirhosoft.com/projects/unity-composition/documentation/#/v10/manual/instruction-graph) based execution model where different [nodes](https://pirhosoft.com/projects/unity-composition/documentation/#/v10/manual/instruction-graph-node) can be connected together to perform custom game logic. These graphs are executed with a coroutine so nodes can easily perform asynchronous tasks like animation. However some nodes, or even entire graphs, need to complete immediately without any frame delay, which is not possible out of the box.

## Background on Coroutines

If you are familiar with the implementation details of coroutines, you can [skip this section](#sowhatstheproblem)

Coroutines are implemented as a wrapper around _iterator methods_. An iterator method is any method with an [IEnumerator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerator) return type that has a yield statement. When an iterator method is passed to [StartCoroutine](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.StartCoroutine.html) Unity will begin executing it immediately. That means on the frame StartCoroutine is called the method will run up to the first yield statement before StartCoroutine returns. The fact that Unity executes the enumerator rather than the runtime is an important distinction that will come up later. You can see this behavior with the following code:

```csharp
public void IsolatedCallTest()
{
	// the Log method just prints the message to Unity's console along
	// with a frame number so we can see where delays are introduced

	Log("IsolatedCallTest");
	var enumerator = IsolatedCallTest_();
	Log(" - calling StartCoroutine");
	StartCoroutine(enumerator);
}

private IEnumerator IsolatedCallTest_()
{
	Log(" - Iterator Started");
	yield return null;
}
```

All the code snippets shown on this page can be found in an example project [available on Github**********]() or in [this unity package**********]() (See [Importing custom asset packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html#ImportingPackages) for usage instructions).

Here are the results:

![Isolated Call](/images/blog/2019-05-27/isolated-call.png)

Notice that `StartCoroutine` was called before `IsolatedCallTest_` was executed even though it looks like `IsolatedCallTest_` was called first. That is because `IsolatedCallTest_` is not actually a method - it is an instantiation of a compiler generated class implementing IEnumerator.

The power of coroutines really comes through with yielding values. Yielding different types of values will cause Unity to delay execution for some amount of time. There are 3 types of yields Unity knows how to interpret:

### [YieldInstruction](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/YieldInstruction.html)

This is the base class for all built in yield types that have special meaning to Unity. [Coroutine](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Coroutine.html) (the return type of StartCoroutine) itself is one of these.

### [IEnumerator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerator)

This interface is implemented by the compiler generated iterator method classes, as well as many collection types that aren't relevant to coroutines. When Unity is yielded an IEnumerator, it simply wraps the IEnumerator in a [Coroutine](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Coroutine.html).

### Anything Else

All other yielded values have no special meaning and simply tell Unity to delay execution until the next frame. Except for some scenarios involving custom IEnumerators, [for performance reasons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39268753/what-is-the-difference-between-yield-return-0-and-yield-return-null-in-corou) you should always be using `null`.

## So What's the Problem?

During the execution of a graph, many different methods are called. Because the graph is a coroutine and nodes need to be able to introduce delay, many of these methods are iterators, meaning we are often yielding IEnumerator values. Anytime one of these iterator methods finishes (whether using `yield break` or by returning without yielding) a frame delay is introduced.

```csharp
public void DelayTest()
{
	Log("DelayTest");
	StartCoroutine(DelayTest1());
}

private IEnumerator DelayTest1()
{
	Log(" - DelayTest1 Start");
	yield return DelayTest2();
	Log(" - DelayTest1 End");
}

private IEnumerator DelayTest2()
{
	Log("- DelayTest2");
	yield break;
}
```

![Delay](/images/blog/2019-05-27/delay.png)

Notice that End was printed the frame after `DelayTest2` yielded. This is the behaviour we need to eliminate.

## The Solution

The interface defined by [IEnumerator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerator) is surprisingly simple:

```csharp
public object Current { get; }
public bool MoveNext();
public void Reset();
```

There are no restrictions on what these methods and property actually do. Unity (or the runtime when using foreach) simply calls `MoveNext` repeatedly until it returns `false` and checks `Current` each time to determine when the next call should happen. So we can write a custom IEnumerator that processes IEnumerators itself rather than leaving it up to Unity. This is called the JoinEnumerator:

```csharp
public class JoinEnumerator : IEnumerator
{
	private IEnumerator _root;
	private Stack<IEnumerator> _enumerators = new Stack<IEnumerator>(10);

	public object Current
	{
		get { return _enumerators.Peek().Current; }
	}

	public JoinEnumerator(IEnumerator coroutine)
	{
		_root = coroutine;
		_enumerators.Push(coroutine);
	}

	public bool MoveNext()
	{
		while (_enumerators.Count > 0)
		{
			var enumerator = _enumerators.Peek();
			var next = enumerator.MoveNext();

			if (!next)
				_enumerators.Pop();
			else if (enumerator.Current is IEnumerator child && !(child is CustomYieldInstruction))
				_enumerators.Push(child);
			else
				break;
		}

		return _enumerators.Count > 0;
	}

	public void Reset()
	{
		while (_enumerators.Count > 0)
			_enumerators.Pop();

		_enumerators.Push(_root);
		_root.Reset();
	}
}
```

The implementation is surprisingly simple. It is created with an IEnumerator to wrap, which it then processes manually as part of its IEnumerator implementation. A call stack is maintained so IEnumerators can be continued after their child has finished, and `Current` values are maintained and propogated so Unity can handle YieldInstructions itself. In `MoveNext` the wrapped enumerator's `MoveNext` is called to advance the iterator. There are three scenarios we need to handle depending on the value returned and the enumerators `Current` value (i.e the value it yielded).

### `next` is `true` and `Current` is an IEnumerator

This is where we solve the root problem. Instead of yielding the IEnumerator back for Unity to process it, we process it ourselves by adding it to the callstack. This IEnumerator will then be processed on the next iteration of the loop (that is the while loop in `MoveNext`). [CustomYieldInstruction](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CustomYieldInstruction.html) is a special case because it is an IEnumerator - so we should let Unity handle it and any subclasses.

### `next` is `false`

The IEnumerator has finished. Normally this is where a frame delay would be introduced but since we are handling processing ourselves, we can continue executing the calling IEnumerator immediately.

### `next` is `true` and `Current` is Something Else

In this scenario we want to actually yield and allow Unity to handle `Current`. Breaking out of the loop and returning from `MoveNext` accomplishes that.

Using the JoinEnumerator now allows any depth of IEnumerators to be yielded without introducing any delay except those that are specifically requested by yielding a [YieldInstruction](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/YieldInstruction.html), [CustomYieldInstruction](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CustomYieldInstruction.html), or `null`.

The following example demonstrates this (along with showing how to use the JoinEnumerator):

```csharp
public void JoinDemoStandard()
{
	Log("Running as Standard Coroutine");
	StartCoroutine(JoinDemo1());
}

public void JoinDemoWrapped()
{
	Log("Running with JoinEnumerator");
	StartCoroutine(new JoinEnumerator(JoinDemo1()));
}

private IEnumerator JoinDemo1()
{
	Log(" - level 1 started");
	yield return JoinDemo21();
	Log(" - level 1 continuing");
	yield return JoinDemo22();
	Log(" - level 1 finished");
}

private IEnumerator JoinDemo21()
{
	Log(" - level 2_1 started");
	yield return JoinDemo3();
	Log(" - level 2_1 finished");
}

private IEnumerator JoinDemo22()
{
	Log(" - level 2_2 started");
	yield return JoinDemo3();
	Log(" - level 2_2 finished");
}

private IEnumerator JoinDemo3()
{
	Log(" - level 3");
	yield break;
}
```

Results of running `JoinDemoStandard`:

![Delay](/images/blog/2019-05-27/standard.png)

And `JoinDemoWrapped`:

![Delay](/images/blog/2019-05-27/joined.png)

Notice `JoinDemoWrapped` performs all execution on Frame 4739 whereas `JoinDemoStandard` executes across 3 frames. A nice side effect is we are also eliminating an allocation of a Coroutine object each time an IEnumerator is yielded.
