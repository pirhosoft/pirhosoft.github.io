# Onward and Upward

Since we have released version 1.0 of [The Art of War](/games/the-art-of-war) and [Photon Phanatics](/games/photon-phanatics) is finished, we are very excited to be moving on to our next project. We don't have a title, or even a code name yet for that matter, but we have lots of excellent ideas brewing. What we know so far is that it will be a single player, story driven platformer, a la Metroidvania with our own fun twists. It'll still be a 2D perspective but everything will be rendered in full 3D which will give us much more room for creativity in world building and will frankly just look better. Our biggest focus is to tell an emotional and thought provoking story because, aside from being fun, that's what we believe games are all about!

With that, we are focusing much more on the visual and audio aspects of the game this time around since those are two of the biggest contributers to atmosphere. Right now, Adam is working on the new rendering system while I, Luke, am honing my musical skills and working on a new audio engine. We're gonna be much more engaged with you guys throughout this developement procces so stay tuned for more news and early prototype screenshots!
