# Project ManIA

Hello world! We're hard at work getting a prototype up and running for our next game and our ideas are shaping up nicely. Some very basic things about story and gameplay we're ready to reveal:


* It's a platformer, shooter, a-la metroidvania, where exploration is key, collectables are plentiful, and fun is abundant.
* We're codenaming our project Projecte ManIA because we'll be exploring the complex relationship between man and artificial intelligence.
* We're still very much concentrating on story as the main motivation to progress and we look forward to (hopefully) making you thing about the larger world and what the future has in store for us.
* It will take you through a mysterious and dangerous research station in space. We don't want to tell you anything about **_WHAT_** they're researching or **_WHY_** you are here since that will ruin the surprise.
* The station is structured as a large rotating cylinder with extending away from the edges.
* You can roam around the circular side of the cylinder and then enter "spindles" that extend transversely accross the station.
* We're coining the phrase **2.75D** where the world is created in full 3D but you can only traverse it in 2 dimensions at a time.
* Take a look at this video below to see what we mean:

We're still a long way away from having anything really tangible to show off but the backbones are coming along nicely. Meanwhile we'll continue and try not to be too distracted by the baseball season (Go Mariners!), and the quickly approching NBA finals.
