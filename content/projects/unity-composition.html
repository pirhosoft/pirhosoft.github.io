		<div class="section-title">Why Use the Composition Framework?</div>
			<p>
				While it may be easy to compare the Composition Framework with other visual scripting tools we like to emphasize that the Composition system is <i>not</i> visual scripting and it is not a simple abstraction of the C# language and Unity's scripting API. What it does
				is take broader actions and events and present them in a flow chart like graph, accessible for all expertises, meaning that designers, programmers, and artists can all create amazing things quickly and with a short learning curve. We use a stack based, unidirectional,
				forward flowing graph that leverages Unity's coroutines to manage timing and control flow, making sequencing events simpler. It is intergrated with numerous other features such as transition effects, data binding, dialog trees, and other user interfaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				As an added bonus, know that it was crafted with love by two passionate people who take lots of pride in polish, and commitment to their customers' needs!
			</p>

		<div class="section-title">Roadmap</div>
			<p>
				Since we use the Composition Framework in our own projects also, we plan to continue supporting and adding new features for the forseable future!
			</p>
			<p>
				Things you have to look forward to are:
			</p>
			<div class="section-sub-title-item">
				<li><a href="https://unity.com/dots">DOTS</a> integration!</li>
				<li>Expression and VariableReference intellisense!</li>
				<li>More logging and debugging info, including a visualizer for variables, bindings and expressions</li>
				<li>Various visual enhancements of the graph window (including better connection drawing and animation</li>
				<li>Continue adding to the node library as well as have a place for users to upload their own nodes</li>
				<li>More transition effects</li>
				<li>Better formatting support for Messages</li>
				<li>Broader support for exposing, editing, and animating properties</li>
				<li>Many more internal tweaks and optimizations</li>
			</div>
